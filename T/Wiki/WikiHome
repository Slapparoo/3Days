==Welcome to the unofficial yet informative TempleOS wiki.
Here you will find topics as they are added. This project's purpose is to create a wiki dedicated to TempleOS and HolyC that is juicy, epic, informative and can help TempleOS users of all kinds of knowledge levels. It is currently in a very premature state, so please keep in mind that many parts of this wiki may not have been finished yet.
